# Multi Live Chat Rooms Project:

When a user goes to the main page they are allowed to either create or join a room. They cannot join room that doesn't exist,
if they try they will be redirected to a special error page which asks them to either create a room or enter a new room to join.
The chat rooms currently show when an user has joined and ask for a username. Can display the number of connected clients
